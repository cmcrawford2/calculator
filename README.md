## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that styling a slider in css is different depending on which browser you're in.
I learned something about how HTML handles numbers. They are mostly strings, but not strings of just numbers. For example, they might have an exponent, they might be Infinity or NaN, etc.
I really struggled with the algorithm for a calculator and ended up with something not quite right, but good enough. The delete key was a real challenge. I've never seen a calculator like that.

### Continued development

I loved this project and I'm going to work on more challenges from frontendmentor.io. I'm not too interested in CSS, though it's important and I can use it. I didn't put shadows around the buttons, and my third style did not match the style guide. I chose a Barbie pink rather than weird dark purples with yellow numbers.

### Useful resources

ChatGPT 3.5 helped me out with some rough spots, though it didn't catch the bug where the number I used for the theme was not really a number, but a string.
